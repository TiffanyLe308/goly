            <h2>Information received by Goly</h2>

            <p>The personal data is primarily collected from you as information voluntarily provided to us, but also
                from external sources or through automated means. In this Section, we describe in detail the personal
                data we collect.</p>

            <h2>Data You Provide to the Goly Platform</h2>

            <p>When creating a Goly Account you must provide access credentials either in the form of an email address,
                phone number and password or by authentication using other services, such as Twitter or Facebook. You
                may optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a short bio and profile
                picture. If you create your Goly account by connecting through another service, we may use public
                information from that connected account to help complete your Goly profile for example by fetching your
                profile picture. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time.
                Profile information is available publicly on our Goly Platform, such as on your profile page. When you
                use or register for our Goly Platform or otherwise interact with us, we may collect the following
                information from our users (“Users”, “you”) that may, in certain circumstances, constitute personal
                data:</p>

            <ul>

                <li>Username;</li>

                <li>Password;</li>

                <li>E-mail address;</li>

                <li>Address;</li>

                <li>Phone number;</li>

                <li>Name;</li>

                <li>Business ID or personal identity number;</li>

                <li>Billing and payment information;</li>

                <li>Product and order information;</li>

                <li>Client contacts and feedback;</li>

                <li>Information concerning the use of the Goly Platform;</li>

                <li>Information necessary for communications;</li>

                <li>Permits and consents; and</li>

                <li>Other data obtained under the User’s consent</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Data Collected from Other Sources</h2>

            <p>We may also collect personal data, where lawful to do so, from public sources and third party service
                providers.</p>

            <h2>Data Collected Automatically</h2>

            <p>Certain technical information may be collected automatically as a standard part of your use of the Goly
                Platform and this information may in certain circumstances constitute personal data.</p>

            <p>Automatically collected data may include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Our servers automatically record information (“Log Data“). The logging technology used in the Goly
                    Platform automatically collects the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you
                    are
                    going when you leave the Goly Platform. We also collect the Internet protocol (IP) address of the
                    device
                    you use to access the Goly Platform, information about the operating system of your device, as well
                    as
                    the name of your Internet service provider, browser type, the referring web page, pages visited,
                    location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We
                    receive Log Data when you interact with our Goly Platform, for example, when you visit our website,
                    sign
                    into our Goly Platform, or interact with our email notifications. Goly uses Log Data to provide our
                    Goly
                    Platform and to measure, customize, and improve them. We will either delete Log Data or remove any
                    common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, within or
                    after 18
                    months.
                </li>

                <li>In addition to server collected log data, Goly uses analytics software to track and report user
                    behavior
                    anonymously through user log information. This data provides us additional information needed to
                    evaluate how our service is used in order to improve our services. This report does not include
                    personally identifiable data. The software has access to this data to process the information
                    earlier
                    stated on behalf of Goly.
                </li>

                <li>Cookies are text files that are saved on the hard drive of your device by means of your browser,
                    enabling
                    us to recognize your browser. Goly may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better
                    understand how you interact with our Goly Platform, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web
                    traffic routing on our Goly Platform, and to customize and improve our Goly Platform. We may place a
                    cookie on the hard drive of the device that you use to access the Goly Platform. Most of the
                    currently
                    available browsers give you the option of managing cookies by, for example, disabling them entirely,
                    accepting them individually, and deleting saved cookies from your hard drive. We do not require
                    cookies
                    for many parts of our Goly Platform such as viewing public videos, but we would like to remind you
                    that
                    if you completely disable cookies on your browser, you might not be able to use some features of the
                    Goly Platform.
                </li>

                <li>We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Goly Platform, including our email
                    notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other
                    means. We do this to help improve our Goly Platform, for example to provide relevant advertising,
                    and to
                    be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked
                    on.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Moreover, details of transactions you carry out through the Goly Platform, and details of your visits to
                the Goly Platform including, but not limited to, traffic data and other communication data may also be
                collected.</p>

                Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of personal data, we cannot guarantee

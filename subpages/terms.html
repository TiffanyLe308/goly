                and/or businesses seeking to obtain services (“Services”) from Sellers and are therefore Buyers of
                Services, and Sellers are individuals and/or businesses seeking to perform Services (“Sellers”) for
                Buyers. Buyers and Sellers together are hereinafter referred to as “Users.”
